DRIPPY LOADING SCREEN v3.1.0 | CHANGELOG [ !! WIP !! NOT READY YET !! WIP !! ]

- Dropped support for (Lex)Forge for Minecraft 1.21+
- Dropped support for Minecraft 1.18.2, 1.21.4, 1.21.8
- Added support for FancyMenu v3.8.0+
- Added features to customize NeoForge's Early Loading Screen
  - There is an editor for easy editing the screen, but it is very basic compared to full FancyMenu/Drippy, because of how limited the early loading screen is
  - You need to have the "Drippy Early Loading Module" installed to customize the screen (can be downloaded on CurseForge and Modrinth)
- Added/Updated the following translations:
  - German (de_de)
  - Greek (el_gr)
  - Mexican Spanish (es_mx)
  - French (fr_fr)
  - Japanese (ja_jp)
  - Russian (ru_ru)
  - Simplified Chinese (zh_cn)
  - Brazilian Portuguese (pt_br)
- Improved how Drippy hooks into NeoForge's custom loading screen and "takes over", to make it more stable and break less other mods that inject logic in there
  - This only applies when the "Drippy Early Loading Module" is not used (otherwise a completely custom loading rendering is used)
- Fixed loading screen not fading in correctly like the Vanilla one (#75, #71)
- Fixed "Vanilla-Like Loading Bar" element ignoring alpha in the HEX color value set as element color (#70)
- Fixed some parts of the screen behind the loading overlay shining through, like text (#65)
