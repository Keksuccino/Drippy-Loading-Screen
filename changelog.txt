CHANGELOG | DRIPPY LOADING SCREEN v3.0.0
 
PLEASE READ:
 
Hey!
 
Just a quick info that this is a full rewrite to make Drippy compatible with FancyMenu v3.0.0+,
so bugs will probably happen! I tried to make old layouts compatible with the new version, but some
specific customizations could not be ported, so make sure to check your layouts and fix them if needed!
 
Thank you and happy customizing!
 
-------------------------
 
- The mod got a full rewrite to work with FancyMenu v3.0.0+
- Dropped support for Minecraft versions below 1.18
 
- Old Drippy config (config.cfg) is not working anymore, you need to copy your settings to the new options.txt file
- The custom color setting of the Vanilla Progress Bar element does not exist anymore
  - Add an "Vanilla-Like Progress Bar" element and hide the original one if your want to continue using a Vanilla-like progress bar with custom color
- There's now a config setting to control if the mod should wait for textures in loading screen layouts to prevent textures from flickering during resource reload
  - This can be helpful but can also make the loading screen freeze when using large textures, so disable this if you experience lagging/freezes
- There's now a config setting to disable the loading screen fade-out

CHANGELOG | DRIPPY LOADING SCREEN v2.0.0
 
~ It's rewrite time! ~
 
This update is a complete 100% REWRITE of Drippy!
That's a good thing, trust me, but there are indeed some BIG CHANGES that come with that:

- OLD LAYOUTS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THIS NEW VERSION!
  I'm very sorry, but I wasn't able to make old layouts work in the rewrite.
  You will need to remake your layouts, which is indeed a bummer, but I think it will pay out.

- Drippy is now basically a FancyMenu extension, which means you have access to almost all of FancyMenu's elements,
  This also means that FancyMenu is now a DEPENDENCY!
  
- You can now use NON-BASIC CHARACTERS in text-based elements!
  That means support for Russian, Japanese, Korean and more characters!
  
- It's now possible to use ANIMATIONS in Drippy,
  which is just one of the many benefits that come from having FancyMenu as dependency!
  
- NO AUDIO SUPPORT ANYMORE!
  Yes, I know, some of you probably want to give me a good ol' punch to the face right now,
  but there's a reason for why audio support didn't make it into the rewrite.
  It's just that the audio engine is not supposed to be ready in the loading screen and initializing it that early,
  which is needed for audio support, can lead to a long list of problems with other mods.
  But don't worry, animation audio is still supported, because animations use a different audio engine.
  
- EXPORTING/IMPORTING SETUPS is now possible via FancyMenu's setup export/import feature!
  FancyMenu now sees the loading screen as normal menu, which also means it saves layouts for the loading screen in exactly
  the same way it does for other menus, so when you export your "FancyMenu" setup, you now automatically export
  loading screen layouts as well.
  
- So much more stuff you know from FancyMenu, like the new placeholder system, etc.!

And the best thing: Since this is a complete rewrite, there will probably be a lot new bugs for you to discover!
Just see them as little easter eggs.

But jokes aside, if you discover bugs (which will probably happen), report them to me, so I can fix them.
Thank you very much!

- Dropped support for Fabric MC 1.16
 
- NEW DEPENDENCY: Drippy Loading Screen now depends on Auudio
 
- Added: Audio element
--> Play background sounds in the loading screen
--> This is only useful for short sounds (or longer sounds, when loading big modpacks), since loading times aren't very long in MC by default
--> Audios get cut at the end of the loading screen, because MC's sound engine gets reloaded (you know, because it's a resource (re)loading screen)

CHANGELOG | DRIPPY LOADING SCREEN v1.4.0

- Added: Placeholder text value '%loadingprogress%', to get the current loading progress in percent
 
- Fixed: Element ID gets copied when copy-pasting an element (should get a new one instead)
- Fixed: Custom Progress Bar element not saving its element ID (gets new one every time it loads)







CHANGELOG | DRIPPY LOADING SCREEN v1.3.1
 
- Fixed: Drippy button in the main menu customizable by FancyMenu (this causes glitched layouts when hiding the button later, so it's now just always invisible for FancyMenu)








CHANGELOG | DRIPPY LOADING SCREEN v1.3.0
 
- Added: Random mode for layouts
  - Randomize layouts by groups, to pick one layout per group when the loading screen gets opened

CHANGELOG | DRIPPY LOADING SCREEN v1.2.1
 
- Fixed: Incorrect character spacing of '/', '\', '|', '1', '(', ')', '[', ']' and ',' in the text rendering system (used to render text of text elements)
  - If you found more characters that look like they're not having the right width or height, please report them, thank you!








CHANGELOG | DRIPPY LOADING SCREEN [FORGE] v1.2.0-1 for MC 1.17
 
- Fixed: Crash when trying to create a new layout (why has nobody except of one person noticed this lmao)









CHANGELOG | DRIPPY LOADING SCREEN v1.2.0
 
- Added support for Forge MC 1.17.1
 
- Lifted minimum required Konkrete version to v1.3.0
 
- Added: Auto-Scaling
  - Just enable auto-scaling and your layout should basically just work at every scale and resolution! No more struggling with different screen sizes!
  - Because of how Minecraft text rendering works, text elements will look a bit blurry at some scales. This can't be fixed and the best workaround is to use images for text.
- Added: Option to enable a grid in the editor for easier aligning of elements (Disabled by default, can be toggled in the mod settings)
  - Editor shortcut to toggle the grid is CTRL + G
- Added: Option to force a GUI scale for the loading screen
- Added: Option to disable the fade-out of the loading screen

CHANGELOG | DRIPPY LOADING SCREEN [FORGE] v1.1.0-2
 
- Changed: Ported text rendering system from Fabric 1.17 to Forge to unify layout rendering
  - This could change the position of your text elements a little bit, so check your layouts for overlapping elements and stuff









CHANGELOG | DRIPPY LOADING SCREEN [FABRIC] v1.1.0-2
 
- Fixed: Text rendering: Some characters cutted off at the bottom
- Fixed: Text rendering: Wrong character width for lowercase "j" character










CHANGELOG | DRIPPY LOADING SCREEN [FABRIC] v1.1.0-1
